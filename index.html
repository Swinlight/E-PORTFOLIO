                <p>Hello!! I am Albert B. Torres. I'm 19 years old and currently residing at Pateros. I am a freshmen
            student at Rizal Technological University and taking the course of Bachelor of Science in Information Technology.
            My hobbies are playing online or video games, watching movies, playing basketball and playing billiard.</p>

                <h1 class=<"headings">Watching Movies</h1>
            <p>I am also highly passionate about watching movies, and it goes deep within me like colorful threads 
            in a beautiful tapestry. Not only is movie-watching my hobby but, rather, a consuming relationship with 
            the art of narrating stories, the essence of visual images, and the importance of such an experience to 
            the human soul. Above all, I am a movie-passionate person because the art requires great effort and skills
            in making it gorgeous. For example, I am constantly looking for new movies to watch and enjoying exploring
            them.</p>

                <h1 class=<"headings">Coding</h1>
            <p>To me, my love for coding is like a fire burning deep within me. It enhances my sense of curiosity
            and innovation while also enabling me to view the digital space in multiple dimensions. Since I wrote 
            my first “Hello, World!” programmer, I’ve been intrigued by how simple lines of code can turn thoughts
            into opportunities while also moulding lives. More than just a technical ability, coding is a type of 
            language for me. It is a piece of paper on which I write my ideas, viewpoint, and aspirations. As I 
            sketch a visually stunning user interface, optimize an algorithm for speed, or solve a turbulent insect,
             each line of code symbolizes my artwork expression- proof of what I wish to accomplish.</p>

                <h1 class=<"headings">Playing Basketball</h1>
            <p>My love of basketball has remained unquenchable while propelling me over and above the limits in both 
            the court and out. When I first handled a basketball, it sounded like music to me since I could feel
            its rhythm as it bounced on the ground before finally swooshing through the net; this was courtesy 
            of my competitive spirit. To me, basketball is not only a game but also life ; it brings joy, unity 
            and improves personal character. In that atmosphere, I am totally drawn into what is happening around
            me as I concentrate my energy in giving it my all for the love of playing.</p>
